# First steps

Using either VSC or Jupyter lab (run `pixi run editor`), go to the root of your project folder and open the `authors.yml` file and specify your name, your institution (and details of your supervisor). 

Next, open the `myst.yml` file, change the title, the keywords, the date and the github url which is set to the original starterkit repo by default.

If you are from another university, you want to change the icons and logo's in the `style` folder, and redirect to these in the `myst.yml` file in the `site - options` section.

```{important} specify correct github repo
In using the template repo, some information that belongs to the original repo are copied as well. It is important to open the `myst.yml` file and set the github url to your own. 
```

If you have made these changes locally, commit and push these changes to github.

## View your thesis online

The previous steps set up your repository with GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow. That action automatically builds your book (a website) and deploys it online. The URL of your book is based on your GitHub username:

```
https://USERNAME.github.io/<reponame>
```


You can also find the link easily from you GitHub repository home page under the "About" section on the right-hand side (illustrated in  {numref}`Figure {number} <fig_folderstructure>`).

You also have automatically two pdf's based on a LaTeX thesis and Typst thesis template. Two buttons can be found at the top right corner to inspect these pdf's.

```{figure} figures/folderstructure.png
:label: fig_folderstructure
```

## Ready?
Ready to write your thesis? Comment out this page in the `toc.yml` file: `- file: content/Quickstart.md` and your thesis repo is set. You can edit the existing files and add new files.

Not familiar with GitHub, VSC, markdown and/or Jupyter Book? All necessary information is covered in our [TUD guide to open publishing with JupyterBook](https://jboss.tudelft.nl/book/). More information is also available in the official [Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/). For quick references, we included a [cheatsheet](./Cheatsheet.md).
